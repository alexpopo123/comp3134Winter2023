I notice that the $token variable in csfr_action.php is not properly set to the csrf_token field
from the form data. Instead, it should be set to the confirmation
field, which is the name of the hidden field that contains the CSRF token value.
To fix this issue, replace $token = $_POST['csrf_token'];
with $token = $_POST['confirmation']; in csfr_action.php
